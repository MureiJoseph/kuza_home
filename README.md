# KUZA Partners Landing Page

Welcome to the source code for the [KUZA Partners](https://kuzapartners.com/) official website. We are architects of organizational excellence, dedicated to empowering growth across Africa and beyond.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains the front-end code for our landing page. We designed this to be a highly-performant, single-page application built on pure HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript, allowing for incredibly fast load times and a premium user experience without the overhead of heavy frameworks.

### Structure

The structure of this project is clean and intuitive:

```
├── assets/
│   ├── css/          # Core styling, variables, and animations
│   ├── js/           # Interactive logic and custom features
│   └── images/       # Static assets 
├── index.html        # The main entry document
└── README.md         # You are here!
```

## 💻 Making Changes

If you need to make updates to the layout or styling, start looking in `assets/css/style.css`.
For interactive behaviors (such as the custom cursor or the navigation menu), check out `assets/js/main.js`.

To preview changes locally, simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
